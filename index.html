<p>This is a repository of materials for a workshop intended to
explore and grow diversity awareness in the Mozilla project.  The hope 
is that these tools and techniques could be useful in many contexts, both 
within technical communities and outside as well.  This workshop's focus is 
people who are involved in an open source community, that has a specific mission, where
participants (both paid and unpaid contributors) represent a wide variety 
of backgrounds and intersections of race, gender, class, sexual orientation, 
ability, religion, as well as other identities and core values.</p>

<p>The goal of this toolkit is to provide up to date materials from instances of the workshop
taking place in various cities and communities so that we are iterating and improving the experience for participants.  After each workshop is run we encourage participants to provide feedback in various forms, one of which is to file an issue here and/or make pull requests.  Of course feedback by email or in person is also welcome if that is more comfortable.  </p>

<p>We welcome and seek additional slide decks, new or alternate versions of the questions for the "Stepping Stones" exercise, localization of the current content, and feedback from workshop leaders on how their workshop went.</p>

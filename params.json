{"name":"Diversity Identity Core Engagement (DICE) Workshop ","tagline":"Exploring how we work in open source community together, with more awareness and understanding of our diversity","body":"![Image of 4 layers in a person that go from small to large](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsblakk/dice-workshop/master/images/dice_layers.png)\r\n\r\nThis is a repository of materials for a workshop intended to\r\nexplore and grow diversity awareness in the Mozilla project.  The hope \r\nis that these tools and techniques could be useful in many contexts, both \r\nwithin technical communities and outside as well.  This workshop's focus is \r\npeople who are involved in an open source community, that has a specific mission, where\r\nparticipants (both paid and unpaid contributors) represent a wide variety \r\nof backgrounds and intersections of race, gender, class, sexual orientation, \r\nability, religion, as well as other identities and core values.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this toolkit is to provide up to date materials from instances of the workshop\r\ntaking place in various cities and communities so that we are iterating and improving the experience for participants.  After each workshop is run we encourage participants to provide feedback in various forms, one of which is to file an issue here and/or make pull requests.  Of course feedback by email or in person is also welcome if that is more comfortable.  \r\n\r\nWe welcome and seek additional slide decks, new or alternate versions of the questions for the \"Stepping Stones\" exercise, localization of the current content, and feedback from workshop leaders on how their workshop went.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

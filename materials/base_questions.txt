Mozillian Pie:
 Everyone will start out on a line in the middle of the room facing one wall, holding hands (if there is not enough room, make several lines.)  As the exercise proceeds, participants are allowed to let handholds go when they become uncomfortable. 
You will be asked to step forward/backward according to criteria.  When I read something that is ambiguous in your case, you get to decide how it applies to you.  You can also decide to not move if it feels too scary to “out” yourself in that way.  There are no “right or wrong answers”; this is to support your own awareness.  It is important to do this exercise in silence.

#Diversity Identity Core Engagement (DICE)

### Intro

The workshop leader should explain about the Diversity & Inclusion Working group, why this is core to Mozilla's mission, and why this exercise. This exercise is about exploring the layers in us from our belief in the core Mozilla values all the way out to our own unique identities and beliefs.

### Design an Alliance

Design alliance about our participation - quick pulse to ask people what do they need to be present and participate fully in the following interactive activity that asks us to share personal interests and  contributions that are core to Mozilla.

Give examples, guidelines - how do we hear, enable and respect others participation

* Male presenting people can wait a beat for women to speak up
* White folks can wait for non-white to speak up
* Anyone who talks a lot can wait for people who haven't spoken to talk
* No cross-talk, don't interrupt
* Trust  & believe people's experiences - you don't have to understand, may  be uncomfortable, doesn't mean it's not true or doesn't exist - learn  more later on your own & with your peers
* Don't  ask people to explain oppression to you, there's lots of material out  there - be an ally, do the work don't ask others to do it for you
* Respect  confidentiality - in these sessions people will be vulnerable, what  happens in sessions stays in session (unless permission from speaker is  given)


### Warm Up - Diversity Matrix

From [Diversity Activity booklet](http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/affirmative_action/content/docs/Interactive%20Diversity%20Booklet%2010-14-2011.pdf)

Discussion points:
 This matrix can tell you a lot about your surroundings.
 Often, people find that their intercultural experiences are clustered; in the residence halls for instance. They often also are passive (one-
way) and not interactive.
 Having this information on paper allows us to use them in new ways. Few other events force us to take stock of our multicultural
interchanges.
 Most people don’t bring this information into their consciousness. They subconsciously are convinced that they are fairly multicultural. It
can be jarring to discover how homogenous our environment is and our environment has had and continues to have an effect on our
beliefs.
 This matrix can give us ideas about how we might enrich our cultural environment and how to reach out to and get to know people who
belong to different groups (Joining a club or community group that includes different kinds of people is an example).


### Stepping Stones

Participants line up in a line, all facing the same direction, with room to both step forward many times (20 steps) and backwards (20 steps). Run through the questions in base questions OR get a set of questions from the database keyed on your location/language once that functionality exists. For now, we just have the base questions and they are North America centric, some questions might want to be removed/replaced by the leader prior to running the workshop.  The goal is to have a fairly even amount of forward & backward step questions. The guiding principle of the questions is that items which would most likely give someone privilege or advantage over others is a 'forward' step while the opposite framing is a 'backward' question.

If working with mix of remote & physical participants, we will provide a grid online (needed) for virtual participants (scale -15 (whatever  number of questions) to 15, and then tape out columns in physical space, number at the top of the column). When complete, people can put their 'number' up on it (the final column you end up in) -- so both local and remote participants can see where each other ends up on this exercise for the discussions later.

### Layers

Share Core Diagram Image (see images folder) and explain the 4 layers [todo - more on this]. Share Mozilla Core Values.

1. In the large group, have everyone write a short list of how they connect with the core values of mozilla (eg: using Firefox, promoting user privacy, explaining mozilla to others) (5 mins)
2. Take 5 minutes to share with the group, in a round, one from each participant -- encourage physical movement by having other participants throw up a finger in a "Plus One!" gesture with the ones they feel that way about
3. In the large group, another 5 minutes on the next layer: your contributions to Mozilla
4. Again go around (opposite direction) and rapid-fire, have each person shout out proudly one of their contributions
5. Now break into groups of 3 (ideally, 4 if necessary) and have each group spend 5 minutes sharing with each other how a specific interest of focus area they have works in connection with Mozilla activities/contributions (my eg: I believe in advancing the participation of women in tech, so WoMoz is a focus area for me)
6. If remote participation is involved, get into video chats, text/audio as backup if no video.  Try to put a remote participant into each group as best you can, so all groups have to work with that constraint.
7. After making sure each person in the groups has shared, now spend another 5 minutes asking the groups to share with each other something from their "outer layer" - things that would be true about them/their values even if they weren't part of Mozilla. These are the things they see as unique about themselves and do not necessarily expect to see reflected back at them from Mozilla (eg: a hobby, gender identity, religious affiliation)
8. Come back into the group as a whole and share thoughts on those two exercises - what did it bring up for people? What are their takeaways from all these exercises? Ask if people will share what they learned through this activity. Note the similarities between groups, or differences.

### Wrap Up

[need a nice rambunctious ending here]

Current Wrap Up: Provide a link this [tool kit](https://github.com/lsblakk/dice-workshop), invite people to join the [diversity working group](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CommunityDiversity) and [mailing list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/community-diversity) if they are interested in further development and leadership in this area. Give everyone a [badge](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/DICE-Workshop-Attendee).

[would be nice to have an exit survey here]
